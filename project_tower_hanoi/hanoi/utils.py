# The Tower of Hanoi problem is inherently computationally intensive for larger numbers of disks because it requires 
# 2^ùëõ‚àí1 moves to solve, where: 
# ùëõ is the number of disks. 
# For 50 disks, this results in a massive number of moves (over 10^15), which is impractical to compute and handle in a single request due to resource constraints.


# Possible solutions:
# 1. Allocate more resources
# 
# horizontal scaling (using multiple servers) 
# verticaly scaling (upgrading server resources)
